            You ever wake up and you're a fuit but you're but you're really unpre-pear-ed for what happeneds next. This is because you are rotten to the core and
            life isn't a sundae with a cherry on top. Orange you happy to have a cool father like me? Now get out you're cup of pineapple juice and berry your
            straw in the cup because you blueberry your chance to be a mango. By the way, what are melons anyway? Have a grape night. ~Darrell Reeves: April 20
